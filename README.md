### Frontend

This is the frontend for my blog. As you can probably tell, it's written with Next.js (a library for React).

### Building

- Clone this repo (https://github.com/Dominic-Hoe/Frontend.git)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` for development mode, and then `npm run build` to build.

### API

Interactions with the API are done through `axios` - it's simple and easy.

### Contributing
